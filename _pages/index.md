HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) is a **evaluation campaign on named entity processing** on **historical newspapers** in **French**, **German** and **English**, organized in the context of the [_impresso_](http://impresso-project.ch) project and run as a [CLEF 2020](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/) Evaluation Lab.

### Key information

*(also visit the 'hamburger' menu on the top right)*

**Tasks:** Named Entity Recognition and Classification and Named Entity Linking.

**Workshop** (update 14.09.2020): information on registration and schedule on this [page](/CLEF-HIPE-2020/Online-Worshop).

**Results** (update 12.06.2020): Now published! Learn more about the results of the 13 teams who participated and submitted more than 70 runs [here](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020/blob/master/evaluation-results/ranking_summary_final.md). Approaches will be described in working note papers presented in Sept at the CLEF conference (online) and published via the CEUR-WS platform.

**Covid-19**: Check the new [HIPE calendar](/CLEF-HIPE-2020/dates) and the CLEF [home page](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/). Final conference will be online. 

**Registration:** [http://clef2020-labs-registration.dei.unipd.it/]( http://clef2020-labs-registration.dei.unipd.it/) until 26 April 2020.

### Motivation

Since its introduction some twenty years ago, named entity (NE) processing has become an essential component of virtually any text mining application and has undergone major changes. Recently, two main trends characterise its developments: the adoption of deep learning architectures, and the consideration of textual material originating from historical and cultural heritage collections. While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. If NE processing tools are increasingly being used in the context of historical documents, performances are below the ones on contemporary data and are hardly comparable. In this context,  the objective of HIPE is threefold:

1. to strengthen the robustness of existing approaches on non-standard input;
2. to enable performance comparison of NE processing on historical texts;
   and, in the long run,
3. to foster efficient semantic indexing of historical documents in order to support scholarship on digital cultural heritage collections.
